This is a random little script I made for a random task at work. The dummy file contains the format, but most of the information has been purposefully omitted or completely changed since my company's records are none of your business. Still, this was my first time using Selenium and xlutils with python and figured I'd share exactly what it is here. It's not exactly reusable code, but here it is all the same.
